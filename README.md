# Clustering Project README

This README provides an overview of your clustering project, including the objectives, data, clustering algorithms used, and the visualization of results.

## Objectives
The main goal of this project is to apply clustering algorithms to real-world data and gain practical experience. Specifically, you will:

1. Cluster a dataset into an optimal number of clusters.
2. Utilize Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering with single linkage strategy and Euclidean distance.
3. Apply K-Medoids Clustering using the Manhattan distance.
4. Choose between FP-growth or naïve Bayes clustering based on your dataset.
5. Visualize the clustering results.
6. Describe the dataset and the target of this application.
7. Explain the insights gained from the clustering results and the interpretation of the plotted graphs.

## Data
### Dataset Selection and Preprocessing
- Download a suitable dataset from sources like Kaggle, UCI repository, etc.
- Assess and clean the data if necessary. It's mentioned that you used preprocessed data, which is a good practice.

## Clustering Algorithms
### 1. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
- Use the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering algorithm.
- Find the optimal number of clusters using the single linkage strategy.
- Consider the Euclidean distance as the distance measure.

### 2. K-Medoids Clustering
- Implement the K-Medoids Clustering algorithm.
- Find the optimal number of clusters.
- Utilize the Manhattan distance as the distance metric.

### 3. FP-growth or Naïve Bayes
- Choose between FP-growth or Naïve Bayes clustering based on the nature of your data. Provide a rationale for your choice.

## Visualization of Results
- Visualize the results of your clustering algorithms.
- Describe the dataset briefly and explain the target of this clustering application.
- Interpret and explain the insights obtained from the clustering results.
- Use graphs and visualizations to support your explanations.

## Conclusion
This README outlines the objectives and steps of your clustering project. It's essential to select the appropriate dataset, preprocess the data as needed, apply the specified clustering algorithms, and visualize the results effectively. Additionally, provide clear explanations and insights gained from the clustering process to achieve the project's objectives. Good luck with your clustering project!
