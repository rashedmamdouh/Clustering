The main goal of this project is to practice and apply clustering algorithms i.
have learned to real-world tasks.
I clustered the dataset into an optimal number of clusters, my was as follows:
● Download any suitable datasets from (Kaggle, UCI repository, etc.)
Assess and clean my data if needed ( i used preprocessed data.)
Import the required libraries and perform:

1.  Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm, find K clusters,
    using single linkage strategy, considering Euclidean distance as the
    distance measure.
2.  K-Medoids Clustering Algorithm find K clusters, use the
    Manhattan distance.
3.  FP-growth or naïve Bayes according to my data.
    Visualize my results
    ○ Describe my data, and my Target from this application.
    ○ Explain my results and insight by describing my plotted graph.
